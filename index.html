            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is BurntToastMan, some of you know me as penn76. I also run <a href="buss://news.now">news.now</a>
, which I hope to become the most popular news site on Bussin' Napture. I'm excited to share a bit about myself.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I live in  Central Ohio, hence the TLD. I lived in Austin, Texas for seven years and was born in and lived in Chicagoland for three years.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I'm currently still in school, although I hope to get a degree in technological engineering. It doesn't matter where I get it from, as long as it's a good school. I'm considering either University of Central Florida (my family has some history there) and the Ohio State University (lots of good programs and my home is just a quick drive up OH-315.)</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I have way too many interests. Some of those incude: Aviation; Roads/Maps; Technology; Public Transit; and so much more. In my free time, I often do coding, web surfing, playing tennis, video gaming, as well as riding my bike. Riding my bike out of the house, to the park or to Dairy Queen, gives me a sense of freedom.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>In the future, I hope to work in the field of digital technology and develop new systems that computers and the internet can work off of. Currently, I'm just a teenager, I can't do much with my life right now, although I hope to get my first job at my local Fresh Thyme or Aldi.</p>
